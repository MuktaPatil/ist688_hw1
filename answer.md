#### Answer to question:
#### Try 4 different models (gpt-3.5, gpt-4.1, gpt-5-chat-latest, gpt-5-nano), using the
same document and question (use our syllabus, “Is this course hard”). Which
answer is best? Which answer is best, including thinking about the cost and
speed? Explain your answer

Answer:
A. Personally I found the gpt-5-nano answer the best. It starts with a TLDR and then provides an explaination on why it believes so.I found the model to be positively encouraging. It also included tips for success in this course and additional tips to help 
the user on their own. It set clear statements on what to expect from the workload and what aspects of the course why make it seem
hard. It signifies deeper understanding to me.


B. Considering the cost and speed, I'd still rate gpt-5-nano answer the best. Here's why:
1. The model is relatively cheaper to use
2. It was quite fast, &
3. Its detailed but not too information heavy.

while gpt3.5 turbo was the fastest for me in this run and the second cheapest model to run, but its answers lack details.
gpt-4.1 is the most expensive of the lot, took a bit of time but provided the most detailed explaination, including a section called "Hard for whom" which discussed what kind of students can expect what difficulty level. I loved how structured the answers were, how the model considered all factors.
gpt-5-chat-latest followed the same detailed structure like gpt-4.1 was just slightly faster and sounds more optimistic than the former, emphasizing the course is rewarding instead of being overly challenging.
gpt-5-nano lacks as rigid a structure as the former two, but includes more personalized sections like "what will help you succeed" and "What to expect in terms of workload". It is also the cheapest of the lot and quite fast, which makes it the ideal choice considering the tradeoffs of cost and speed.
However, if the details of the content were more important than its speed, gpt-4.1 would be the right choice.
