### 1. Answer using gpt-3.5-turbo

This course may be challenging for some students, especially those who are new to AI applications and large language models. 
However, the course description indicates that no prior AI experience is required, so as long as students are willing 
to put in the effort to learn and engage with the material, they should be able to succeed in the course. It is important 
to attend class, participate in discussions, complete assignments on time, and seek help from the instructor or classmates 
when needed. With dedication and hard work, students should be able to do well in this course.

### 2. Answer using gpt-4.1

Whether IST 688 – Building Human-Centered AI Applications is "hard" will depend on your background, experience, and expectations. 
Here's a breakdown based on the syllabus:

Prerequisites
Python required: You need to know Python or have taken IST 687.
No AI experience required: The course is designed for people new to AI, which may make it easier if you already know Python.
Workload & Assignments
Labs: 5 in-class labs (generally manageable if you attend and participate).
Homework: 7 homeworks (due weekly; some may require more time depending on your familiarity with the material).
Teamwork: Topic presentation (4 people/team) and a final project (2-person teams).
Exams: 2 in-class exams.
Participation: Expected in class.
Content
Technical skills: You’ll learn to use APIs/libraries like OpenAI, Streamlit, Langchain, etc.—so you’ll do real coding and hands-on work.
Conceptual: Includes prompt engineering, responsible AI, ethics, and memory techniques.
Projects: Final project requires integration and creativity.
Grading
Multiple dimensions (HW, labs, exams, presentations, projects, participation).
The grading scale is straightforward, with an A starting at 93%.
Time Commitment
Weekly assignments: Regular deadlines.
Team coordination: Required for team project/presentation.
Project: May take significant work toward the end of the semester.
Difficulty factors
If you know Python: The technical side may be straightforward.
If you're new to coding: It may be challenging. But no prior AI experience is required, which makes it accessible for non-experts.
Hands-on orientation: If you like building things and learning by doing, you may find it fun—if not, you could find it difficult.
Keeping up: The pace is steady, so falling behind may make things harder.
Summary
For a graduate-level, hands-on class, this course seems accessible if you have basic Python skills. It doesn’t assume prior AI experience and is designed to bring students up to speed with real-world AI development, focusing on practical, applied projects.

Hard for whom?

Easy to moderate: Anyone comfortable with Python and willing to learn new tools.
Hard: Students new to programming, or those who dislike teamwork or frequent assignments.

### 3. Answer using gpt-5-chat-latest

Good question! Whether IST 688 – Building Human-Centered AI Applications feels hard will likely depend on your background, interests, and time management. Let's break it down:

1. Prerequisites
The only prerequisite is Python programming knowledge (or having taken IST 687).
That means you don’t need prior AI/ML experience—so the course is designed to be approachable for students new to AI but with some coding comfort.
2. Course Content
You'll be working with large language models (LLMs), APIs (like OpenAI), Streamlit, RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), LangChain, and responsible AI principles.
Much of the learning is hands-on and project-driven, which makes it engaging but also potentially time-intensive if you're not used to building applications.
3. Assignments and Workload
5 Labs (in-class) – low stakes (1 point each, total 5 pts).
7 Homework assignments – worth 20 pts total, with some involving coding and one explicitly non-coding.
Team Topic Presentation – 15 pts, including an in-class activity you design.
Final Project (group of 2) – 25 pts, major creative/technical work.
Exams – Two exams (20 pts + 10 pts).
Participation – 5 pts.
This is a fairly balanced mix: steady smaller assignments, one big project, and two exams. Nothing seems overloaded, but consistent weekly effort will be required.

4. Grading
Fairly standard scale—an A requires 93+.
Attendance/participation matter a little (5 pts), but consistent completion of homework and project work should carry most of the grade.
5. Difficulty
Manageable if: you are comfortable coding in Python, open to learning new APIs, and enjoy hands-on projects.
Can feel hard if: you’re new to coding, procrastinate on the project, or are unfamiliar with working in groups.
Since many tools are documented well (LangChain, OpenAI, Streamlit), a lot of the challenge is just learning how to combine them thoughtfully.
6. Biggest Challenges
The final project requires creativity, initiative, and technical integration (so it’s the heaviest workload).
Keeping up with weekly homework is important so you don’t fall behind.
Some student-led presentations mean that part of the learning is collaborative and less rigidly structured.
✅ Overall: It’s designed to be accessible to grad students without AI experience, but it’s not a “light” course—you’ll need consistent weekly effort, comfort with Python, and collaboration. Most students with basic coding and curiosity about AI will likely find it very rewarding rather than overly difficult.

Would you like me to give you a difficulty comparison to other grad-level IST courses (like IST 687 or IST 736) 
so you can better gauge how it might feel?

### 4. Answer using gpt-5-nano

Short answer: it’s a solidly challenging graduate course, especially if you’re new to AI or to hands-on prompt engineering 
and system integration. If you already have solid Python skills and some API experience, it’s very doable but 
still workload-intensive.

What makes it hard

Hands-on, project-focused: 5 in-class labs, 7 homework assignments, a team project, and a final presentation. You’ll be building real apps with LLMs and likely debugging integration issues.
Steep learning curve in tools: OpenAI API, LangChain, Streamlit, Ollama, retrieval augmentation (RAG), memory/short-term memory for chat, and evaluating model outputs.
Two exams plus ongoing assessments: you’ll need to study for exams and also keep up with weekly HWs and lab work.
Ethical and responsible AI emphasis: you’ll be asked to think about bias, harms, and real-world impacts, which adds conceptual depth.
Possible costs and setup friction: while the course estimates under $10 for usage, you’ll be running APIs and may need to manage costs and environment setup, especially if you’re prototyping with larger models.
What will help you succeed

Strong Python background (libraries, APIs, basic data handling).
Comfort with learning and integrating new libraries quickly (OpenAI/OpenAI Cookbook, LangChain, Streamlit, etc.).
Time-management and consistent study pace (several components across 14 weeks, including group work).
Interest in building practical AI apps and willingness to iterate on prompts and architectures.
Team collaboration for the project and presentation.
What to expect in terms of workload

Regular HWs and labs woven into weeks; expect a few hours per assignment, plus time for the final project and its milestones.
A group project with a milestone-driven timeline; early planning helps a lot.
Exams that test both theoretical understanding and practical application.
Tips to decide

If you’re excited by building live AI apps and don’t mind a steep but structured workload, you’ll likely find it rewarding.
If you’re not comfortable with Python or you’re not prepared for a lot of hands-on tool use and debugging, it could feel quite demanding.
If you share a bit about your background (Python experience, prior AI exposure, comfort with APIs), I can give a more tailored sense of how tough it might feel for you and some concrete prep steps.
